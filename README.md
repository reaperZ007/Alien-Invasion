# Alien-Invasion

An alien invasion game in Python using Pygame is a classic arcade-style shooter where the player controls a spaceship at the bottom of the screen, tasked with defending Earth from waves of descending alien invaders.

Game Overview:
Player Controls:
The player maneuvers a spaceship left and right using the arrow keys (or 'A' and 'D') and fires projectiles upward with the spacebar to destroy incoming alien ships.

Aliens:
The aliens appear in rows at the top of the screen, moving horizontally in unison. When they hit the edge of the screen, they descend closer to the player, increasing the tension. As the game progresses, their speed increases, making it more challenging.

Projectiles & Collisions:
The player can shoot bullets to eliminate aliens. If a bullet collides with an alien, the alien is destroyed, and the player earns points. The aliens might also fire projectiles downward, and if the player's ship is hit, they lose a life.

Winning & Losing:
The player wins by clearing all the aliens on the screen. The game is lost if the aliens reach the bottom of the screen or if the player's lives run out.
